I am currently providing volunteered support to some of the web resources of the radio station [I used to manage](http://www.kdvs.org), and looking for a full-time position where I can leverage my existing Python, Django, and Linux experience in a fast paced, quick turn around production environment with a strong engineering discipline to grow my skills.\r\n\r\n### Current Projects\r\nI am currently providing support for KDVS 90.3 FM's [fundraising](https://fundraiser.kdvs.org) and [library](https://library.kdvs.org) websites on a volunteer basis.\r\n\r\n### Currently Reading\r\n- Dark Pools\r\n- A Random Walk Down Wall Street\r\n- What Color is your Parachute?\r\n\r\n### Technical Proficiency\r\n#### Proficient\r\n##### Languages:\r\n- Python (2 Years)\r\n- C (2 Years) \r\n- C++ (2 Years)\r\n- HTML/CSS (2 Years)\r\n\r\n##### Web Technologies:\r\n- Django (2 Years)\r\n\r\n##### Operating Systems:\r\n- Linux (11 Years)\r\n- Windows (11 Years)\r\n- Windows Server (1 Year)\r\n- Max OSX (1 Year)\r\n\r\n#### Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (Less than one year)\r\nPostgreSQL, Bash (Scripting), Javascript\r\n\r\n### Development Environment\r\nArch Linux, Vim, Terminal (RXVT-Unicode with Fish-shell)\r\n\r\n### Experience:\r\n[ ASUCD Creative Media](https://creativemedia.ucdavis.edu/) - Davis, Ca  \r\n\r\nProgrammer, Linux Server Administrator (October 2014 - January 2016)\r\n\r\n- Managed computing resources for KDVS 90.3 FM and other ASUCD units efficiently enough to be assigned additional web development responsibilities including porting an unmaintained PHP site to Django.\r\n- Worked in a small team of 8 people which required me to be intimately involved with every detail of my projects since resources were spread too thin to allow for much specialization\r\n\r\n[ASUCD KDVS 90.3 FM](http://www.kdvs.org) - Davis, Ca \r\n\r\nGeneral Manager (May 2013 – May 2014)\r\n- Managed 22 paid staff and over 100 active volunteers of a variety of ages and backgrounds, with a budget of $133,000 per annum\r\n- Successfully negotiated an $8,000 budgetary increase at the end of my term to cover long term expenses and to reflect a $10,000 increase in fundraising revenue\r\n- Coordinated a $120.000 project which resulted in a 30% increase in broadcast strength from 9 KW to 13 KW\r\n\r\nBusiness Manager (June 2012 – June 2013)\r\n\r\n- Experienced the departmentalization of services within a large organization\r\n- Learned how to read and stay within a $100,000 budget\r\n- Experience purchasing processes within large organizations\r\n\r\n[UC Davis Student Housing](http://housing.ucdavis.edu/) - Davis, Ca\r\n\r\nResident Computing Advisor (April 2012 – December 2013)\r\n\r\n- Improved customer service skills\r\n- Gained insight on usage patterns of novice computer users\r\n- Learned to work as a team with coworkers meeting for only one hour each week\r\n\r\n###Projects:\r\n####KDVS Library \r\n(June 2015 – February 2016)\r\n\r\nPorted an existing website in production for 9 years written in PHP to Django, which required a complete rewrite due to the former site’s lack of maintenance.
